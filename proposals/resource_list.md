# Workshop/Resource Repo

## Target audience

Organizers and community leaders within Florida hackers, or anyone else interested in hosting a workshop.

## Community needs

Creating a good workshop takes a lot of time, a lot of love, and sometimes skills orthogonal to the content of the workshop iteself.

This proposal aims to streamline the process of sharing workshops, and other resources, amongst members of the community interested in hosting workshops for their students.

## Resources

A GitHub repository.

## Media

Gwen's _Git & GitHub_ workshop shall serve as the first example of a workshop as a shared resource within Florida Hackers.

Depending on the appraoch, a contributions guide shall serve to lay out precise instructions for adding a shared resource.

## Timeline

This proposal takes only a few hours to implement once an approach is decided.

## Questions & Feedback

- Do we create a repository and maintain it like an "awesome lists" repo? (Gwen's preferred approach)
- Do we simply keep and update forks of resources (esp. workshops) or do we transfer resource repositories(esp. workshops) to FloridaHackers's GitHub organization?
- Do we keep git submodules of resources (when applicable) in the repo?
