# Workshop/Resource Repo

## Target audience

Organizers and community leaders within Florida hackers, or anyone else interested in hosting a workshop.

## Community needs

Creating a good workshop takes a lot of time, a lot of love, and sometimes skills orthogonal to the content of the workshop itself.

This proposal aims to streamline the process of sharing workshops, and other resources, amongst members of the community interested in hosting workshops for their students.

## Resources

A GitHub repository, and access to FH branding materials to make a sick `README.md`.

## Media

Gwen's _Git & GitHub_ workshop shall serve as the first example of a workshop as a shared resource within Florida Hackers.

A contributions guide shall serve to lay out precise instructions for adding a shared resource, along with a pull request template to guide community members that want to propose a resource.

The repository will act much like an awesome lists repository, where we keep links to and descriptions of resources rather than copies of the resources themselves. This shall:

1. limit the burdon of maintenance
1. allow content creators to own their content
1. simplify logistics of adding resources

## Timeline

This proposal takes only a few hours to implement once an approach is decided.
