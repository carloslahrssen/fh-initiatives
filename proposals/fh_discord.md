# Florida Hackers Discord Chat 

## Target audience

<!-- Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal? -->
Not only will the discord improve communication for FH Organizers with permission based rooms, it also allows a more open community of Florida Hackers to be active on discord from the rest of Florida.

## Community needs

<!-- What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal? -->
When it comes to determing whether or not Discord should be used over Slack, it's important to note that Slack isn't entirely free and has a user limit for the free tier. 

With Discord, Florida Hackers will have the ability to grow its community without the need for limiting the amount of users in the chat.

1. Create Discord 
2. Set up structure of discord (Permissions and whatnot)
3. Market the switch from Slack to Discord
