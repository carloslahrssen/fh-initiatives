# Florida Hackers Initiatives

_(This is in beta. Descriptions and processes are subject to change.)_

This README explains how to propose an FH-Initiative.

# What is Florida Hackers?

Florida Hackers is a statewide community dedicated to growing the hacker culture in Florida, connecting creators across the state, promoting community building, and leaving our sunshine state a little brighter than before. Florida Hackers is fueled by the community, so to promote our mission, we need people like you to help.

# What is an FH-Initiative?

An FH-Initiative is a project that is undertaken by members of the Florida Hackers community where hackers like you can contribute to the mission.

The project can be anything! From documenting the stories of hackers, to handling group travel, to even hosting a conference, you choose your contribution. Anyone can start anything as long as they are willing to document and propose the work to be completed. The ideas are up to you.

Any Florida Hacker can propose ideas, call for organizers, and organize events - all that is needed is a pull request. Before it can be an initiative, it must start as a proposal with a clear roadmap & goal. Don't worry; we will show you in our template how to make a suggestion.

# How do I submit a proposal?

 - Fork the repo.
 `git clone https://github.com/floridahackers/fh-initiatives.git`
 - Copy proposals/sample-proposal.md and name the file with your proposal name.
 - Fill out the questions.
 - Submit a pull request and start a discussion. Feel free to invite a friend or the community.

# It got approved! What's next?

You will get access to a repo in our organization for your project in addition to our logo and branding assets. Additionally, a Slack channel will be made to help organize your communication. We will do our best to help out.

# I want to talk to someone about this first!

[We would love to see you on our Slack in #fh-initiatives!](https://floridahackers.slack.com/signup)

### Happy Hacking!
