# Organizer Retreat

## Target audience

We hope to help the population of all hackathon organizers. 

## Community needs

We want to make sure that hackathon organizers keep in touch and develop a sense of comraderie and support as they organize their events through a low investment retreat.

## Resources

- An AirBNB
- Hackathon Organizers Accross The State

We can set up a tilt (if that still exists) to crowd fund for the rental while petitioning for food.

## Media

Social media post on the FB and any organizer group chats.

## Timeline

1. Find out organziers who are interested in attending
2. Plan a gathering with food
3. Find a date

Aim for late October to have the retreat.
